A Templated C++ matrix library which aims to provide an easy to use interface for basic and intermediate vector-vector, vector-matrix & matrix-matrix operations.

> **Note**

> This library is on an ongoing re-write to improve the api and use more modern C++ features. To see the old working implementation of this library check the [version_1.9](https://github.com/mrdcvlsc/cyfre/tree/version_1.9) branch or [download it here](https://github.com/mrdcvlsc/cyfre/tree/version_1.9).

### **About**

This repository started in december 2020 as a personal hobby project **not intended** to replace big matrix libraries like [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), [OpenCV's - cv::Mat](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/d63/classcv_1_1Mat.html) or [BLAS](https://www.netlib.org/blas/) and is **only for didactic purposes**. Though performance is still a priority, meaning this library will... as much as possible, use the fastest and the most efficient algorithms and implementations THAT THE AUTHOR(s) KNOW OF.
