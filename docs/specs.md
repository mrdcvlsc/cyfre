# Implementation Specifications

## **Rules**

1. No virtual tables in the front-end API classes/structs (not virtual methods and overriding).
2. Only support C++20 and above.
3. Intensive use of template programming.
4. Support constexpr if possible.
5. Make the **front-end** interface easy to use no overcomplication and complexity.
